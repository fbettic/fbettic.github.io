            Hello :D, my name is Federico Bettic, i'm 23 years old and i'm a
            developer (and almost a Computer Engineer).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm from Argentina and I'm currently in my last year of my computer
            engineering career (that's why the "almost" hehe), at the Blas
            Pascal University, I studied at a technical high school and
            graduated as an Electronic Technician.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I like the most is music although I'm not very good with
            instruments, my favorite artist is John Frusciante (both in and out
            of RHCP), I love retro, whether video games, music, movies or
            appearance in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of my hobbies are drawing, listening to
            music, making small home automation/robotics/electronics projects,
            and I'm currently trying my hand at 3D printing.
          </p>
